##How to run this code##
There are two ways to run my code
a) python run_train.py 
This will run the code on the GPU assuming your theanorc etc is well set.
Please run this command from within the folder 


b)python nested_train.py
This will also do the same as a) from within the folder the code is placed in.

Method a) will reproduce the memory error with the version of theano I run(0.7).
method b) is a quick fix for this error.

There are couple of other scripts like mem_test that will run with a memory profiler
from pip.

Let me know if you would like that.
